<!-- Hello,
that is the sample file of how the test excersise could be solved. That one is basing on in memory database from python to handle the issues. 
Of course it is not compleated as there should be some additional error handlers for instance for score below zero, update of score that is lower than previous, other table with Team Names to make sure the values are correct etc. 
But to show how solution could work I think that is enough. 

HOW TO USE IT:
run init.py
uncomment and use any of the three functions (startNewGame, updateScore, finishGame) with your parameters having in mind there is no error handling and exceptions in case incorrect input -->
